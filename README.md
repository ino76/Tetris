# Tetris
This is just simple Tetris game, made as tutorial from [MethMethMethod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2aW5V46khA)
Only the basic tetris functionality is implemented for now. I'm planning another releases with multiplayer and online multiplayer.

[HERE](http://dn8.cz/js/tetris/index.html) you can try the latest version of the game on my website ...

## **Controls:**
[ ⇦ .. move left] \[ ⇨ .. move right] \[ ⇩ .. move down] \[ ⇧ .. move completely down]

\[ **Q** .. turn left] \[ **W** .. turn right]

Below are buttons for playing on your phone / tablet.
